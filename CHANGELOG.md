# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.1] - Unreleased

### Added

- **Ollama Provider Base URL Override**: Added provider-level `baseUrl` override capability specifically for the Ollama provider.
    - Users can now configure a custom base URL in `chp.providerOverrides.ollama.baseUrl` settings.
    - This allows connecting to local Ollama instances (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`) or custom Ollama endpoints.
    - The base URL field appears in VS Code settings intellisense only for Ollama provider.
    - When configured, all Ollama models will use the custom base URL.

- **OpenCode Zen Go Provider**: Added a new OpenCode Zen Go provider with dedicated endpoints for GLM-5, Kimi K2.5, and MiniMax M2.5 models.
    - OpenAI SDK endpoint: `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions`
    - Anthropic SDK endpoint: `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages`
    - Added `opencodego.json` provider configuration with model-specific endpoints.
    - GLM-5 and Kimi K2.5 use OpenAI SDK at `/chat/completions`.
    - MiniMax M2.5 uses Anthropic SDK at `/messages`.
    - Added provider support in account management, account UI, and status bar components.
    - Added `chp.opencodego.setApiKey` command for API key configuration.

    - Removed the base URL option from the generic provider wizard.
    - Removed generated `chp.<provider>.baseUrl` settings and related provider metadata flags.
    - Kept explicit model-level `baseUrl` support where model configuration already supports it.

### Fixed

- **Copilot Chat Context Window Token Counting**: Improved token counting for VS Code Copilot Chat so the Context Window panel can render usage more accurately for custom models.
    - Extended the shared token counter to support newer VS Code language-model message/content shapes such as `LanguageModelChatMessage2`, `LanguageModelToolResultPart2`, `LanguageModelDataPart`, and thinking parts.
    - Updated generic provider token-count handling so VS Code can request counts using the newer chat message API types.
    - Improved counting for structured tool result content and text-like data payloads used in modern chat requests.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

    - Also updates the Add Account provider list, provider display-name map, and API-key account sync list from known provider metadata.
- **Settings Page Provider Settings**: The Settings page now renders provider settings from the extension configuration schema instead of relying on a small hardcoded field list.
    - Supports client-side editing of provider settings like base URL, endpoint, SDK mode, and other manifest-backed provider options.

### Fixed

- **Settings Page Search**: Fixed the provider search input in the unified settings page so filtering works while typing instead of effectively resetting interaction on re-render.
- **Settings Page Provider Controls**: Fixed Blackbox so it is no longer treated like a no-config provider and now exposes provider settings consistently.
- **Known Provider Merge Typing**: Fixed a `knownProviders.ts` type error when applying preferred provider base URLs during config merging.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-03-04

### Removed

- **Gemini CLI and Antigravity Providers**: Removed both providers as they were leading to account banning.
- **Gemini SDK Utilities**: Completely removed Gemini SDK-related code, including `GeminiStreamProcessor`, `GeminiSdkCommon`, and `GeminiSearchTool`.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Blackbox AI Default API Key**: Added `defaultApiKey: "xxx"` to Blackbox AI provider, allowing it to work without explicit user configuration.
- **User-Agent Pool**: All providers now use rotating browser-like User-Agent strings from `USER_AGENT_POOL` for better compatibility.

### Fixed

- **Open Model Endpoint Support**: Fixed `openModelEndpoint` flag not being respected in `DynamicModelProvider`. Providers with open model endpoints (NVIDIA, Chutes, Hugging Face, Kilo AI, LightningAI, Ollama, OpenCode, Zenmux, Blackbox, etc.) now correctly fetch models without requiring an API key.
- **Blackbox AI Authorization**: Fixed `401 Unauthorized` errors by properly using the default API key when no user-configured key exists.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Open Model Endpoint Support**: Added `openModelEndpoint` flag to `knownProviders.ts` for providers that allow model fetching without an API key.
    - Enabled for: AIHubMix, Blackbox AI, Chutes AI, DeepInfra, Hugging Face, Kilo AI, LightningAI, ModelScope, NanoGPT, NVIDIA NIM, Ollama, OpenCode, and Zenmux.
- **Blackbox AI Headers**: Added required custom headers (`customerId`, `userId`, `version`) to Blackbox AI provider configuration.

### Fixed

- **Dynamic Model Update Logic**: Fixed an issue where background model updates were skipped when models were already cached. The system now always triggers a background fetch for providers with dynamic model support to ensure config files and cache stay up-to-date.

- **Production Config File Paths**: Fixed issue where provider config files could not be found in production builds.
    - Updated esbuild configuration to copy provider JSON configs from `src/providers/config/` to `dist/providers/config/` during build.
    - Changed all provider file paths from `src/providers/config/` to `dist/providers/config/` to match production bundle structure.
    - Affected providers: Zhipu, MiniMax, Moonshot, and all dynamic model providers.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-02

### Added

**Provider Sync Automation:**

- **`sync-providers.js` Script**: Created automated synchronization script to generate all provider-related artifacts from a single source of truth (`knownProviders.ts`).
    - Auto-generates `ProviderKey` enum in `src/types/providerKeys.ts`
    - Auto-updates provider configurations in `src/accounts/accountManager.ts`
    - Auto-syncs commands, settings, and activation events in `package.json`
    - Run with: `npm run sync-providers`

**New Providers:**

- **NanoGPT**: Added support for NanoGPT provider (OpenAI SDK-compatible)
    - Endpoint: `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1`
    - Dynamic model fetching enabled
    - API key configuration via `chp.nanogpt.setApiKey` command

**Declarative Provider System:**

- **Zero-Code Provider Definition**: Providers can now be defined entirely in `knownProviders.ts` without needing individual provider folders, classes, or JSON config files.
- **Unified SDK Compatibility**: All providers now support a unified configuration structure with `openai` and `anthropic` SDK compatibility modes.
- **Automatic SDK Switching**: Added `sdkMode` setting for dual-SDK providers (DeepSeek, Moonshot, AIHubMix, Ollama, etc.), allowing users to switch between OpenAI and Anthropic protocols with a single setting.
- **Auto-Sync package.json**: Implemented logic to automatically keep `package.json` settings, activation events, and registrations in sync with the provider registry.

**Dynamic Model Discovery Refactor:**

- **Generic Dynamic Provider**: Introduced `DynamicModelProvider` which centralizes model discovery logic for all OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **Auto-Update Static Configs**: The system now automatically creates and updates `.json` configuration files in `src/providers/config/` when new models are discovered via API.
- **Intelligent URL Construction**: Improved model endpoint resolution with automatic path normalization (prevents redundant `/v1` segments).
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added robust deduplication to prevent multiple registrations of the same model during dynamic updates.

**Enhanced Model Support:**

- **Claude Opus 4.6**: Added specialized support for Claude Opus 4.6 with a 1,000,000 token context window and 64,000 token output limit.
- **Ollama Dynamic Support**: Fully integrated Ollama with dynamic model fetching and dual-SDK (OpenAI/Anthropic) support.
- **AIHubMix Dynamic Support**: Enabled dynamic model discovery for AIHubMix via the `/models` endpoint.

### Changed

**Codebase Simplification:**

- **Removed 10+ Provider Folders**: Deleted specialized provider implementations for `kilo`, `chutes`, `huggingface`, `lightningai`, `opencode`, `zenmux`, `nvidia`, `mistral`, `minimax`, and `moonshot`. These are now handled by the generic dynamic system, reducing codebase complexity by ~40%.
- **Unified Registration Flow**: All providers (except specialized ones like Gemini/Antigravity) now use a single, consistent registration path.

### Fixed

- **Settings Page Rendering**: Fixed an issue where declarative providers were not appearing in the modern settings interface.
- **Mistral Duplicate Models**: Resolved a bug where Mistral models were being registered multiple times.
- **URL Construction**: Fixed incorrect model endpoint URLs for providers with nested path structures.
- **Wizard Compatibility**: Ensured specialized configuration wizards (MiniMax, Moonshot) still work correctly within the new dynamic system.

- **Quota Display in Status Bar**: Added Antigravity (Cloud Code) quota status bar showing remaining quota for Gemini and Claude models.
    - Separate status and bar items for Gemini Claude quotas.
    - Color-coded display: Red when <10% or over budget, Orange when <30% or slightly over pace, Green when >=30% and on track.
    - Click to refresh and view detailed quota in QuickPick.
    - Shows model-specific quota information with reset times.
    - **All Models Display**: Tooltip now shows all available models (no 5-model limit) with colored quota badges.
    - **Real-time Refresh**: Status bar always fetches fresh data on click (no caching).
- **Leader Election**: Implemented master instance election to ensure only one VS Code instance runs periodic status updates.
- **User Activity Detection**: Pauses background status updates when user is inactive (30 min timeout).

**Gemini Vision Support:**

- All Gemini models (gemini-2, gemini-2.5, gemini-3, etc.) now support vision capabilities across all providers.
- Excludes gemini-cli provider which handles Gemini models through a separate path.

### Fixed

- **Removed `<think/>` Placeholder Logic**: Removed unnecessary `<think/>` placeholder output when thinking models return only thinking content without text content. This eliminates redundant placeholder tokens in chat responses across all providers (Anthropic, Claude, DeepInfra, Zenmux, Gemini, Mistral, LightningAI, HuggingFace, Blackbox, OpenAI, OpenCode).

- **TypeScript Type Compatibility**: Fixed type errors where several provider implementations had private `updateConfigFileAsync` methods that conflicted with the base class `GenericModelProvider`'s protected method signature. Renamed provider-specific methods to unique names (e.g., `updateOpenCodeConfigFile`, `updateZhipuConfigFile`, etc.) to resolve the type incompatibility.
- **Ollama Vision Capabilities**: Fixed an issue where Ollama models (like `kimi-k2.5`) were not correctly reporting vision capabilities. Now uses the centralized `resolveGlobalCapabilities` for consistent capability detection across all providers.
- **NVIDIA Auto-Registration**: Fixed an issue where the NVIDIA provider was not automatically registering with VS Code on startup without an API key. It now correctly inherits the background-fetching logic from `GenericModelProvider`.
- **Ollama Base URL Normalization**: Fixed potential double slashes in API URLs when `baseUrl` ends with a trailing slash.
- **Ollama Provider Migration to Anthropic SDK**: Shifted Ollama provider to use Anthropic SDK instead of OpenAI SDK for API requests. This aligns with Ollama's Anthropic compatibility API (`https://ollama.com`). Also disabled thinking/thinking_content output by default for Ollama requests to avoid unnecessary reasoning content.

**Gemini CLI Provider Fixes:**

- **Model Name Resolution (404 Fix)**: Fixed "Requested entity was not found" error by stripping the `google/` prefix from model names before sending to the Gemini API. The API expects bare model names like `gemini-2.5-pro` instead of `google/gemini-2.5-pro`.
- **Tool Schema Sanitization**: Fixed `Invalid JSON payload received` errors by implementing comprehensive tool schema cleaning:
    - Removes unsupported JSON Schema fields (`exclusiveMinimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, `value`, etc.) that cause 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT` errors.
    - Sanitizes property names to match `[a-zA-Z0-9_]*` pattern.
    - Handles nested schemas in `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf` composite types.
    - Filters `required` fields to only include properties that exist in the schema.
- **Authentication Fallback**: Improved authentication error handling to properly fall back to local CLI credentials when managed accounts fail.
- **Thinking Configuration**: Corrected thinking config format for Gemini 3 (uses `thinkingLevel` string) vs Gemini 2.5 (uses `thinkingBudget` numeric).
- **Request Headers**: Added proper Gemini CLI headers (`X-Goog-Api-Client`, `Client-Metadata`) to match official `google-gemini/gemini-cli` behavior.

### Changed

- **Faster Startup**: Extension now returns static config models immediately during startup (silent mode) for faster initialization.
- **Improved Model Discovery**: In non-silent mode (when user interacts with chat), models are fetched from the API in the background and the model list is automatically refreshed.

### Fixed

**Gemini CLI Token Refresh:**

- **Fixed Token Endpoint**: Updated OAuth token endpoint from `accounts.google.com` to `oauth2.googleapis.com` for more reliable token refresh.
- **In-Flight Request Deduplication**: Added request deduplication to prevent race conditions when multiple requests trigger token refresh simultaneously.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added detection for `invalid_grant` errors (revoked refresh tokens) and automatic cleanup of stale credentials.
- **Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff with jitter for transient network failures during token refresh.
- **Better Debug Logging**: Added logging for token rotation detection and refresh status.

### Code Refactoring

**Gemini SDK Consolidation:**

- **New `gemini` SDK Mode**: Introduced dedicated `sdkMode: "gemini"` type for providers using Gemini-compatible APIs (Antigravity and Gemini CLI).
- **Shared Gemini SDK Utilities** (`src/utils/geminiSdkCommon.ts`): Centralized common logic for Gemini-compatible providers:
    - `sanitizeGeminiToolSchema`: Tool schema sanitization for Gemini API compatibility.
    - `convertMessagesToGemini`: Message format conversion to Gemini-compatible structure.
    - `validateGeminiPartsBalance`: Validation for function call/response pairing.
    - `balanceGeminiFunctionCallResponses`: Automatic balancing of function calls and responses.
- **Shared Stream Processor** (`src/utils/geminiStreamProcessor.ts`): Unified `GeminiStreamProcessor` class for SSE streaming:
    - Handles SSE streaming, thinking tags, tool calls, adaptive buffering.
    - Supports both Antigravity and Gemini CLI providers via `GeminiStreamHandler` interface.
    - Consolidated ~1,500 lines of duplicate code from separate processor implementations.
- **Updated Model Configs**: Changed sdkMode from `"anthropic"`/`"openai"` to `"gemini"` for all Gemini-compatible models in `antigravity.json` and `geminicli.json`.
- **Token Counter Updates**: Gemini mode now uses Anthropic-style token counting (system message + tool definition costs).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Global capability normalization**: Added centralized `resolveGlobalCapabilities()` and `isVisionGptModel()` functions in `globalContextLengthManager.ts` to enforce consistent capability flags across all providers.
    - All models now have `toolCalling: true` by default
    - All GPT models (except gpt-oss) and Kimi-2.5 models have `imageInput: true` by default
- **Blackbox provider**: New OpenAI-compatible Blackbox provider and model list (src/providers/blackbox). Includes streaming support, model registration, and config integration.
- **Chutes API-driven token limits**: Chutes provider now uses the API's `context_length` field to determine token limits dynamically, instead of using global defaults. Output tokens are calculated as: >= 200K context → 32K output, >= 128K → 16K output, < 128K → 8K output. Input tokens = context_length - output_tokens.
- **Config maintenance scripts**: Added scripts to enforce/verify model token limits across provider configs:
    - `scripts/set-kimi-minimax-context.js` — set MiniMax/Kimi entries to 256K and correct image-capabilities
    - `scripts/verify-kimi-minimax-context.js` — sanity-checks for MiniMax/Kimi token/capability settings

### Changed

- **Standardised large-context models**: All MiniMax and Kimi models updated to 256K total context (maxInputTokens = 224000, maxOutputTokens = 32000). Only `kimi-k2.5` exposes vision input.
- **Global output-size rule**: Models with reported context >= 200K now default to maxOutputTokens = 32K; otherwise maxOutputTokens = 16K. Applied consistently across static configs and dynamic model loaders.
- **Runtime normalization**: Dynamic model fetchers (Chutes, DeepInfra, HuggingFace, LightningAI, Zenmux, OpenCode, Antigravity, Zhipu, etc.) now normalize token limits and capabilities at runtime to match static config rules.
- **GPT‑5 family token limits**: GPT‑5 class models updated to a 400K total context budget — maxOutputTokens = 64K and maxInputTokens = 336K. This was applied across static configs (opencode, codex, zenmux, lightningai, etc.) and the runtime normalization (resolveTokenLimits) so GPT‑5 metadata is preserved during model discovery; UI/tooltips updated to reflect "400K context / 64K output".

### Fixed

- **Ollama fixed**: Updated the Ollama provider's model definitions to reflect the correct context length (see `src/providers/config/ollama.json`). This resolves token-counting and stream-finalization issues.
- **Mistral config corrected**: Mistral models' token limits updated so 256K-context models use maxInputTokens = 224000 and maxOutputTokens = 32000 (`src/providers/config/mistral.json`).
- **Tooltips & UI text**: Corrected tooltips that incorrectly referenced “200K” to say “256K” where applicable.
- **Config drift fixes**: Fixed multiple providers where dynamic model metadata could drift from project-wide token/capability rules; now enforced both in config files and at runtime.

- **Enhanced Mistral & OpenAI SDK Robustness**:
    - Added automatic `type: "function"` injection for tool calls in `MistralHandler` and `OpenAIHandler`. This fixes crashes (e.g., `missing choices[0].tool_calls[0].type`) when using providers that omit mandatory fields in their streaming responses.
    - Improved `OpenAIHandler` to also check `message.tool_calls` for providers that send final tool calls in a message object instead of a delta.
- Replaced deprecated "managementCommand" entries in contributes.languageModelChatProviders with vendor-specific "configuration" schemas (for example, adding apiKey secret properties). This aligns the extension with the VS Code Language Model API and removes deprecation warnings.
- Removed unsupported "canDelegate" property from chatParticipants (Gemini CLI participant) to resolve package.json schema validation errors.

### Fixed

- **Tool Call ID Consistency**: Fixed a critical issue where tool calling would fail in multi-turn conversations due to ID mismatches.
    - `OpenAIHandler` now captures and preserves the original `tool_call_id` from the provider instead of generating random ones.
    - Fixed missing tool call reporting in **Chutes**, **HuggingFace**, and **DeepInfra** providers.
- **Stream Finalization**: Fixed "missing finish_reason for choice 0" error by automatically injecting a final chunk with `finish_reason: "stop"` if the stream ends prematurely.
- Fixed package.json JSON schema/lint error caused by the deprecated managementCommand usage and the unsupported canDelegate property. Lint was run to validate the change.

### Chore

- Updated package.json and created a commit: "chore: replace deprecated managementCommand with configuration schemas for languageModelChatProviders; remove unsupported canDelegate property".

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-11

- **Multi-Account UI**: Added Mistral AI and DeepInfra support to the Account Status Bar and Account Manager.
- Replaced ESLint with Biome for linting and formatting. Added `biome.config.json`, updated `package.json` scripts (`lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `format:check`) and removed `eslint.config.mjs`. Updated documentation references in `AGENTS.md`.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Tool Calling Crash**: Resolved `Error: missing choices[0].tool_calls[0].type` which affected several OpenAI-compatible providers.
- Fixed DeepInfra registration in `package.json` to ensure it appears in the Language Models list.
- Fixed Mistral and DeepInfra status bar colors and display names in the account management UI.

### Fixed

- **Fixed Function Call/Response Mismatch Error**: Resolved "Please ensure that the number of function response parts is equal to the number of function call parts of the function call turn" error by adding automatic balancing logic in the OpenAI handler to ensure every tool call has a corresponding tool result message and vice versa.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Changed / Improved

- **Provider streaming architecture**: Migrated Chutes, HuggingFace, and OpenCode providers to use official OpenAI TypeScript SDK for robust streaming:
    - **Chutes**: Refactored to use OpenAI SDK, eliminating premature response stopping issues. Added dynamic model fetching from API with auto-update of config file (`src/providers/chutes/chutesProvider.ts`).
    - **HuggingFace**: Migrated to OpenAI SDK for reliable streaming and proper reasoning content handling (`src/providers/huggingface/provider.ts`).
    - **OpenCode**: Already using OpenAI SDK via GenericModelProvider (no changes needed).
    - All providers now properly handle reasoning/reasoning_content (thinking content) similar to OpenAI handler.
- Authentication and provider reliability:
    - Antigravity: improved OAuth/auth flow and provider handling (`src/providers/antigravity/auth.ts`, `src/providers/antigravity/provider.ts`).
    - Codex: authentication and handler fixes (`src/providers/codex/codexAuth.ts`, `src/providers/codex/codexHandler.ts`).
    - GenericModelProvider: refactor and improved ExtensionContext/token counting support (`src/providers/common/genericModelProvider.ts`).
    - Compatible & MiniMax: reliability and model handling improvements (`src/providers/compatible/compatibleProvider.ts`, `src/providers/minimax/minimaxProvider.ts`).
    - OpenAI: handler and streaming fixes and robustness improvements (`src/providers/openai/openaiHandler.ts`, `src/providers/openai/openaiStreamProcessor.ts`).
    - Qwen Code CLI: always reload CLI OAuth credentials before requests, added rate-limit cooldowns, and integrated with AccountManager for managed accounts and optional load balancing (`src/providers/qwencli/auth.ts`, `src/providers/qwencli/provider.ts`).
    - Gemini CLI: added rate-limit cooldowns, invalidateCredentials support for 401 responses, and integrated with AccountManager for managed accounts and optional load balancing (`src/providers/geminicli/auth.ts`, `src/providers/geminicli/provider.ts`).
- Completion and editor integration:
    - Improved completion behavior and inline completion shim for better suggestions and stability (`src/copilot/completionProvider.ts`, `src/copilot/inlineCompletionShim.ts`).
    - Extension activation and provider registration updates (`src/extension.ts`).
- User interface and status bar:
    - Account UI and status updates, including account manager and status bar improvements (`src/accounts/accountStatusBar.ts`, `src/accounts/accountUI.ts`, `src/ui/accountManager.js`, `src/ui/modelEditor.js`, `src/ui/settingsPage.js`, `src/ui/settingsPage.ts`).
    - Token usage and combined quota popup fixes/enhancements (`src/status/tokenUsageStatusBar.ts`, `src/status/combinedQuotaPopup.ts`, `src/status/antigravityStatusBar.ts`).
- Tools and utilities:
    - Minimax and Zhipu search improvements and registry updates (`src/tools/minimaxSearch.ts`, `src/tools/zhipuSearch.ts`, `src/tools/registry.ts`).
    - Improvements to configuration, logging, and web search utilities (`src/utils/configManager.ts`, `src/utils/logger.ts`, `src/utils/mcpWebSearchClient.ts`).
    - OpenAI stream processing and token counting fixes (`src/utils/openaiStreamProcessor.ts`, `src/utils/tokenCounter.ts`).

### Fixed

- **Fixed premature response stopping**: Chutes and HuggingFace providers now use OpenAI SDK which properly handles stream completion, eliminating premature stopping issues.
- **Fixed reasoning content rendering**: Chutes and HuggingFace now properly render thinking/reasoning content similar to other providers.
- Various bug fixes addressing completion, streaming, authentication, and concurrency issues that improved stability across providers and the extension.

### Miscellaneous

- Minor code style, refactor, and maintenance updates.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-07

### Chore

- Release and publishing: Build VS Code extension (.vsix), create GitHub release, and publish the release to Visual Studio Marketplace (OEvortex.better-copilot-chat).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- New provider: **Chutes** (`https://llm.chutes.ai/v1`) with 14 models including Qwen3, GLM-4.7, DeepSeek-R1, and more.
- New provider: **OpenCode** (`https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`) with 26 models including Claude 4.5, Gemini 3, GPT-5, and more.
- New provider: **Qwen Code CLI** (OAuth via CLI) with models like Qwen3 Coder Plus/Flash.
- Added "(Free)" suffix to OpenCode models with zero pricing (MiniMax M2.1, GLM-4.7, Grok Code, Big Pickle).
- Global request limit tracking for Chutes provider (5,000 requests/day).
- Status bar items for Chutes and OpenCode providers.

### Fixed

- Import issue in `TokenCounter.ts` that caused build failures.
- Refactored `GenericModelProvider` to expose `ExtensionContext` for subclasses.
- Fixed Qwen Code CLI authentication issue ("Missing API key") by properly passing OAuth tokens to the OpenAI handler.
- Fixed Gemini CLI provider: align request payload with Google Code Assist API (use model/project/user_prompt_id/request schema), call loadCodeAssist to detect project/tier before streaming, and avoid sending unsupported fields (userAgent/requestId/sessionId) which could return HTTP 500 INTERNAL errors. (PR: geminicli provider initial implementation and bugfix)
- **Updated Gemini CLI OAuth authentication** to match reference implementation:
    - Replaced environment variable OAuth credentials with official Google OAuth client credentials
    - Improved token refresh logic with proper concurrency control using refresh locks
    - Enhanced error handling with proper HTTP status code responses
    - Added `invalidateCredentials()` method for handling 401 authentication errors
    - Added `forceRefresh()` method for manual token refresh
    - Updated `ensureAuthenticated()` to always reload credentials from file for external updates
    - Fixed path construction issue with Windows path separators
    - Added debug logging for credential path resolution
- **Fixed configuration error**: Added missing `antigravityQuotaWatcher.apiKey` configuration to prevent runtime errors.

## [0.0.0] - Previous Version

- Initial release with ZhipuAI, MiniMax, MoonshotAI, DeepSeek, Antigravity, and Codex support.
